# Programming

A conglomerate of programming projects, code snippets, and configuration files. Almost all physically typed by me, but no guarantees on the author. A couple examples of things I extracted from others include work in the "The C Programming Language" and Beej.
Will be used as a testbed for projects that may warrant their own repository.
