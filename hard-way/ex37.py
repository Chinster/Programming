# Keywords
# and - &&
# del - deletes a variable. As effective as foo = None, but more readable. Also deletes the variable from namespace.
# from - specify package to import from
# not - !
# while
# as - creates an alias
from sys import argv as filenames
# elif - else if conditional
# global - specify a local variable to be available in global scope. This means available to everything within the python module.
# or - ||
# with - encapsulates exception handling using a 'content manager'. Covers try-catch-finally
# assert - throw exception if given condition isn't true 'assert False' throws AssertionError
# else - Can be used with a for statement if the if conditional in a for statement never executes!
# if - conditional
# pass - null operation. Useful as a placeholder
# yield - shorthand for creating generator functions which allow you to manage data, particularly lists, without storing all of it in memory
# break - terminates a loop
# except - Exception handling. "Catch" try: open(file) catch IOError: print fail to read
# import - imports libraries/packages/modules
# print - prints to stdout
# class - defines a class class IOError(Exception): def __init__(self):
# exec - reads and executes an object
# in - calls __contains__ method of a class. default loops through arrays. Used for for-loops 'for x in range(0,10)'. or checking if a String is in a stringif 'you' in 'your mom' -> True
# raise - throws last exception or RunTimeException if called with no parameter. If given an Exception Object throws said object.
# continue - skip rest of code in loop. Return to conditional
# finally - executed after a try-catch / try-except
# is - compares memory locations. Similar to String comparisons in java using ==.
# return - return statement for methods/functions
# def - create a function
# for - for loop
# lambda - creates anonymous functions and function objects. lambda x: x % 3 == 0, [1, 3, 4] 
# try - for exception handling. If an exception is thrown, exits
